Integrating M-Pesa into your website involves several steps:

Prerequisites:

M-Pesa Business Account: You'll need a registered M-Pesa business account. This allows you to receive payments and access the M-Pesa API for integration. You can apply for one through the M-Pesa for Business portal (https://www.safaricom.co.ke/main-mpesa/for-your-business/business-one-account).
Paybill or BuyGoods Number: This unique identifier allows customers to direct payments to your business. You can request one during M-Pesa business account registration.
Integration Process:

Safaricom Developer Portal: Sign up for an account on the Safaricom Developer Portal (https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/). This grants access to M-Pesa API credentials and development tools.
z
API Credentials: Generate API keys (Consumer Key and Consumer Secret) within the developer portal. These are required for authentication when your website interacts with the M-Pesa API.

Choose an Integration Approach: There are two main options:

SDKs/Libraries: Safaricom offers pre-built libraries like Daraja for various programming languages (PHP, JavaScript etc.). These simplify the integration process.
Manual Integration: For more control, you can directly interact with the M-Pesa API using its documented requests and responses.
Develop the Integration Code: Following your chosen approach, write the code that interacts with the M-Pesa API. This will typically involve:

Initiating a Payment: Your website sends a request to M-Pesa with details like amount, phone number, and Paybill/BuyGoods number.
User Redirection: The user is redirected to the M-Pesa mobile app to authorize the payment.
Callback URL: Define a URL on your website where M-Pesa will send a notification after the transaction (successful or failed).
Testing and Go-Live: Thoroughly test your integration in a sandbox environment before deploying it live on your website. Safaricom provides test credentials for this purpose. Once satisfied, enable the live option within the developer portal.
